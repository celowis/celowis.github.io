            <h3>Week 1:</h3>
            In the first week of Information Architecture, we paired up and started working on our first assignment,
            which was to create  a small exhibition to do with sounds: either current, past, or potential. During
            the course of the week I met up with my partner, Lauren Ferreira, and we discussed possibilities for
            what the final project could look and sound like. We explored the possibilities of sounds of nature,
            school, and all the concerts we’ve been to. Finally, we decided to focus on sounds from our childhoods,
            I constructed the audio for the listening experience with Adobe Premiere Pro, taking audio from my own
            recordings as well as free use audios online Lauren and I decided to look for. Lauren created the poster
            for the visual experience of the exhibition and we were ready to present it.

            <h3>Week 2:</h3>
            For this project was a small listening station that aimed to allow listeners to hear sounds reminiscent
            of their childhoods. To create this, my partner Lauren Ferreira and I discussed sounds that made us
            nostalgic. We got a wide array of sounds from the cicada-clad woods of Missouri to the soft ocean waves
            of Massachusetts. We also discussed our favorite pop-culture videos and games from the late 2000’s to
            early 2010’s, such as the Disney fast play introduction, Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses, and of
            course, Wii Sports. With this collage of sounds, Lauren put together and illustrated a collage depicting
            the both of us as small children with the title of our installation, “The Sounds of Nostalgia”. To set
            up our space, we used a children’s pair of bluetooth headphones to listen through, and hung up the
            collage, as well as a placard for the exhibit and a bibliography of our sources.Listen to the final
            audio file here. (WARNING: May be loud)

            <h3> Week 3:</h3>
            For the first week of this new project, we explored the listening experiences of multiple apps in
            relation to a specific context. The context chosen for this preliminary research was customization and
            profiles. With this in mind, with a partner I analyzed how apps like Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix use
            customization and individual profiles to enhance the listening experience for their users.
            <h3> Week 4:</h3>
            After this first week of research, we moved onto individual brainstorming on what we wanted to make our
            feature provide for the app and its users. For my project, I chose Spotify because it had been my primary
            music app for several years and I felt like due to its already existing customization, it was the most
            personal app for me.     The inspiration for my feature came from Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist. As
            much as I love exploring new music, I often don’t know where to start and so I often use the Discover Weekly
            playlist that Spotify generates for each of its users every week. Unfortunately, I often find that the
            playlist contains several songs and artists that I’ve heard before, and it sticks to the same genres I
            already habitually listen to. With this, I feel like I’m not actually discovering new music, but adding many
            similar songs that make all of them blend together.     The feature I chose to implement in week two of this
            project was aimed so that users could employ it to help them search for songs outside of their established
            music taste without having to type anything in a search bar. I gravitated towards the discovery and
            suggestions context for my app feature since I feel like that is one of my main problems with the Spotify
            app. As stated above I really enjoy the suggestions Spotify gives based on a user’s listening history,
            however I often find the suggestions don’t really stand out to me compared to the songs I already listen to.
            To solve this problem, my feature would use your listening history not to suggest similar songs, but songs
            from way outside of a user’s audio history in order to cleanse the palette of their ears and to help make
            music stand out again.
           <h3> Week 5:</h3>
            To help figure out what to concentrate on in my feature, I created some personas of potential users, one of which was modeled after myself: a college student who listens to their playlists to death and eventually gets tired of all the songs starting to mush together. The other: an older woman who has been listening to her favorite songs for years and years, but wants to branch out to newer, different music, but just doesn’t know where to start. With these, I started to figure out what stood out and what was going to be utilized the most. I narrowed it down to the advantage of not having to search for something specifically and to have several ways to search for new music.
         <h3>Week 6:</h3>
            After creating the first set of wireframes in Figma, we revised them in class by talking over them with our peers and discussing the flow of the feature as well as how instinctual the navigation was and how easy it was to understand what was going on. We also discussed how likely we each were to use each other's app features and small things we could do to improve the original wireframes.  Some notes for my feature at this critique included matching system colors with the Spotify branding, clearing up some blurry images, and enlarging some text to make it more readable.    We also worked on our storyboard and script for the video portion of how we will display our feature. How to display the key elements of the feature using the persona we made for it, and how to make sure it creates a narrative that isn’t too instruction-forward for the audience. With the script for our storyboards we made sure to keep in mind how we wanted the screen to look and whether we would have an audible voiceover for the video or typed out screen captions.
