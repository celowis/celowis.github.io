      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p>In this project, students had to brainstorm possible restaurant ideas and come up with some of its characteristics: What kind of food would they serve? What particular dishes? Who would work there? What kind of people would dine there? Where would it be located? What kind of music would they play? What would the interior of the restaurant look like?  While brainstorming ideas for my restaurant, I thought back to all my memories with food, cooking, baking, going out to eat, being cooked for by my parents, etc. With this sort of mind-map laid out, I decided my restaurant was going to be a pub, though it would include a full-scale bakery as well so people could sip on nice pub drinks and talk to one another over a delicious pastry. My main inspiration for the pub/pastry restaurant comes from my father, though his work trips to Boston (and to see me here too) are infrequent, we are always guaranteed to meet up for dinner, and to start and end the night in a local pub. Although, only having just turned 21, my selection of the pub menus were very slim, especially if I didn’t want a greasy plate of food or a traditional British pudding. So I created a place where people like my dad and I would be able to chat and have fun, where both of us could enjoy the menu. Thinking about how I would change the pub food to suit my own taste was easy, I have a long love of baking that started in middle school that I get to expand each summer I’m home from college. So with my experience of researching new recipes and trying them all out with my family, it felt like my pastry menu was just putting itself together. </p>
