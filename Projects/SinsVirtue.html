      <h2>Poster Series</h2>
      <p>“Sins &#38; Virtues” was a project from my Spring 2024 Typography for Print class. The aim was to make
        eye-catching posters promoting the Sins &#38; Virtues exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. We were
        tasked with choosing either three sins or virtues to display on our series of posters.
        My take on the project was to view the virtues in the highest regards, being so pure and sweet and beautiful
        that it has to be deceiving, being too nice to even look at. With this meaning in mind, I set to visualize it
        through objects wrapped in cutesy sweet ribbons and sparkles. Each virtue being spelled out through the ribbon
        itself, meandering in and out of each poster frame. For charity, I chose kitchen utensils and cooking objects to
        show the giving nature that cooking provides, nourishment to others. The objects chosen for Humility were hair
        bows, flowers, and makeup, depicting pride in appearance, both humbling one’s unaltered appearance by deeming it
        unworthy to be left uncovered. I chose soaps and facial serums for purity to show the desperation in a pure
        appearance and cleanliness I think of when I think of the virtue.
        With these objects, I set out to arrange them in a way that would bring out their meaning in their respective
        virtues as well as show how twisted and deceiving they could be. Through the pastel colors of the objects and
        sparkles, I aimed to show the light innocence in each of these biblical values. To contrast these light colors,
        I inverted each of the objects and put them against a dark background.
        Arranged around the frame of each poster, you can see the information for the actual Sins &#38; Virtues
        exhibition. Included are the website link, V&#38;A logo, as well as the title and dates of the exhibition. All
        the information uses the same basic framework and structure, yet all are arranged on their posters to best fit
        their respective compositions.</p>
