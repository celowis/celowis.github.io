        <h2>Flow Chart</h2>
        <p>In the first week of this project, we were introduced to the assignment and started working on the survey questions we would send out to students. As a class, we all wrote down questions and narrowed them down into three categories: school, life, and icebreakers. We read each question aloud and quickly decided if we would keep them, effectively narrowing down our question pool to only 21 questions. Once we got our survey, individually we set about collecting answers from MassArt students
          My initial thought was to create a Google Form to send out rather than having to ask people directly. After creating a form, I sent it to the RA of my dorm’s floor, who then sent it out to the whole floor. Unfortunately, I only got about 3 answers this way, 6 off of what I needed to collect. To gather more, I printed out QR codes to the form and pasted them around the Industrial Design work floor and library. I only got 1 answer this way though, mostly because I hung them up on the weekend when nobody was working. I asked a Senior in my studio elective to fill out the form the next school day, so I only needed 4 more. Luckily, a friend who was also sending out the survey got a big response, and was kind enough to share 4 of their responses with me (thank you Lennie). </p>
          <p>During the second week of this project, we were tasked with making a poster showcasing data from at least 100 of our responses, and including at least 7 questions from the survey. To start this one-week project, I began researching how I might want to display the data, and all the different kinds of charts and graphs. I used https://datavizproject.com/ to help inspire me by looking at their graph overview examples, as well as the specific examples they show from different designers and their interpretations of the chart layouts.
            With this, I started off making a large sankey diagram connecting some of the question responses together. Unfortunately, through doing this I realized I wouldn’t be able to connect all the different kinds of questions I wanted to include in an easy way. So I switched my thinking and started working on a flow chart, one of the most fun forms of data in my opinion since it’s very interactive, and therefore, enticing to read. I used a few broad demographic questions from the survey to divide the responses up, aiming to narrow down the responses to 1 -3 specific individuals at the end of each branch of the flow chart. I got to use a lot more questions through this organization than I got to with the sankey, and it felt more natural of a flow. Though it was hard picking which questions I would use where, mostly due to the amount of space given, I couldn’t do broad questions like “whats your first initial” or “what’s your hot take” since they were a bit too open ended and I wouldn’t have room for 26 or more branches to just a single question. After I had completed the base organization of my flow chart, I needed to decide how I would present it, as a random 24”x36” flow chart on a wall isn’t as enticing to read and something that has a reason for going through the flow chart. Luckily, through creating the flow chart I was reminded of magazine quizzes I would take in tween magazines at the library while my mother would look through books. Things like American Girl Magazine or Girl’s Life would include hot quizzes like “what’s your true hair color?” or “what TV show would you be on?”, and as a young girl those were very alluring to me. I used some inspo from random web images of these and marketed my flow chart as a “Best Friends Quiz”, claiming that through answering these questions, you would eventually find your true BFFs at MassArt. With this in mind, looking up girly handwritten typefaces and choosing a blue and pink color scheme it all started to come together.</p>
