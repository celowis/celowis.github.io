          <p>  Hello, My name is Charlotte Lowis! Educationally, I come from the Missouri Public school system before transitioning to Boston in 2022 to pursue a BFA at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I am a Communication Design major and have taken classes such as Typography courses for print and digital media, Communication Design History,  and Graphic Design studios where we designed icons, postcards, posters, and developed branding systems. I really love MassArt’s emphasis on communication within their graphic design curriculum because it gives us students insight into how to visually convey things for others and how to really create something that is not just appealing to look at, but has meaning behind it and the choices that were made to create it.</p> <p> Through my education, I’ve gotten a lot of experience in many Adobe programs, my best being Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop, and a bit of work in Adobe Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Aero, and Dimension. Aside from Adobe, working in Figma designing digital wireframes for websites and all the basic Google programs such as slides, docs, sheets, and drawings.</p><p>My past work experience so far has been two jobs I got during high school, firstly I was a lifeguard for a few months at my local YMCA just before the COVID pandemic. Then in 2021 I got hired at Breakout Games St. Louis where I’ve seasonally worked as a “game master” ever since. I’ve really loved this seasonal job not only because of the great people I’ve gotten to know and become friends with, but it introduces me to people that are local to the St. Louis county area as well as traveling tourists from around the country. With this job I have learned how to interact with customers better, how to manage my time, and how to communicate with my customers to help them work together throughout the game experience.</p></div>
