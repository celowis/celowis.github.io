            <h3>Logos</h3>
            After answering a lot of these questions, we moved onto our first week of sketching. I drew over 100
            variations of pen-and-paper sketches of what the logo for my restaurant may look like. During class the next
            week, we all stared at each other’s logos for a long time and figured out which ones we were drawn to, but
            of course needed a bit of work still.
            To refine my logos, I took about six to ten of my originals and digitized them in Adobe Illustrator, and
            tried to create several variations of each. Changing the style of the line strokes, minimizing each of them
            down to just a few shapes, and completely deleting them and making them back up again. Anything to change
            them that might help refresh my eyes and give me enough contrast between one another so that my eyes had to
            be drawn somewhere.
            To pick what would become my final logo, I wanted something that could be simple, repeatable, but unique.
            Something that put some of the aspects of my pub together. I ended up on a set of two: an icon form and a
            script name. The form I chose is a silhouette of a madeleine with a funky letter “M” inside depicting the
            grooves of the cake as well as providing the vague shape of the underside of a wine glass. To bring out the
            wine glass shape a bit more, without making it obvious, I created a gap in the middle of the uppercase “M”
            to act as the stem of the glass, and I curved the bottom terminals of the “M” up as if the foot of the glass
            were under it. I also really wanted to have a name/title logo, since pubs seem to always have huge gold-ish
            lettered signs outside. For this lettered logo, I leaned into a hand-drawn script look to bring out the more
            feminine-baking aspect I viewed my pub having.
            Finally, after picking the logos to continue to work on, I started on finalizing them both. Making those
            tiny changes in Illustrator that somehow make three hours pass and your back hurt from working at a
            too-short-desk. However, with this final logo ready to go, I got to start thinking about how we would apply
            the logo and name to things like menus and merchandise.
            <h3>Menus</h3>For the first week of thinking about how I wanted the menus for my pub to look, I gravitated
            towards using a more generic, common typeface to try and make the vibe of the restaurant a bit more casual
            as compared with the almost art deco looking logo. For the two drafts I showed (shown to the right), I used
            a typewriter typeface and a sans-serif, cleaner and more geometric typeface. Although after an in-class
            critique I realized how it toned down the feeling of the pub so much it didn’t really stand out, so I
            revised my thinking and went into the next week of the project by finding a typeface that would more emulate
            the vibe my logos already give out.
            Another thing I was figuring out with these first drafts was how to align all my text, especially with the
            inclusion of price tags on every item, how to make it readable and contain a proper hierarchy without taking
            up too much room. I tried a lot of left alignment in the first drafts, although I did have one center
            aligned menu (not pictured) that I overlooked at first since I regretted the typeface I used on it. After
            looking solely at the alignment, I decided that center alignment was the way to go, as it would echo the
            symmetry of my main logo icon.
            For the second round of working on these menus, I found a good serif font that I felt really drove my brand
            forward and enhanced both the symmetry of the icon logo as well as complimented the script logo. Of course,
            with finding this font, I center aligned my menus and began working on my brand patterns.
            <h3>Patterns</h3>
            My initial draft of patterns can be partially seen in my first menu drafts to the right. Using my logos, I
            toned them down to just the “M” and the outline of the madeleine shape and repeated and reflected them in
            Illustrator. While I do still think these patterns are cute, they just don’t feel very dynamic, or nearly as
            thought-out as my logos. I also wanted to use a wine glass icon I had cut out from the silhouette of my
            madeleine logo to showcase one of the forms behindmy symbol logo. After a while of looking at these though,
            they just didn’t reinforce the brand image I had in my head for Madeleine’s. I wanted something dark and
            alluring, comfortable but not totally safe. So I went into another week trying to figure out how to make
            something read “nighttime” without necessarily making the whole thing have a black background.
            My first thought to do this was to use bitmaps made in photoshop of different black to white gradients and
            lay them down behind some of my brand patterns to give them a bit more to interact with other than a glaring
            white page. So I made some gradients as you can see to the right, and used the diffusion dither at 100
            pixels per inch, to get a bit more of a grainy printed effect, and laid it down behind my slightly adjusted
            symbol patterns.
            Yet again, after looking at these printed out for a while and conferring with classmates, it still seemed a
            bit hokey, not quite there yet, and still not part of the full concept I had in mind. Luckily, I had a
            critique set up with my teacher who, among other suggestions, said I could use the actual forms of
            madeleines and photography as my brand patterns, that they didn’t necessarily have to be a repeated shape.
            That really unlocked something in my brain because as much as I wanted these symbol patterns to work, I had
            already spend weeks on them where each version didn’t live up to my expectations, so it was time for them to
            go.
            I took images from pinterest and google images and obscured them a bit in photoshop, playing with grayscale,
            gaussian blur, and the curves tool, to make them into higher quality bitmaps, around 300 pixels per inch.
            With these, you could still see the beautiful blurred forms and shapes the madeleines made, yet only for a
            bit before the page ended or the text began. I really loved how these patterns turned out as I think they
            show off the enticing nighttime aspect of the pub &amp; pastry, and of course, they show off the pastries
            very
            well.
            <h3>Brand Applications</h3>
            To start thinking about how I would apply my brand, I thought about my customer base and what specific
            things I could make for them specifically that would fit within my pub. I landed on a pastry box as my main
            application, since I had such an emphasis on food that’s been thought out through its creation, I wanted to
            make something for it. A pastry box would be perfect since it would compliment the bakery, in case someone
            wants a delicious little snack for the T ride home, or just doesn’t need a drink to go with it. To design my
            box I first looked at some online takeout box templates. After printing a few out and folding them up, I
            made notes of what I liked and didn’t like about each, and also tried to narrow down the size I wanted. They
            needed to be big enough to fit any one of the desserts on the menu, yet snug enough that they didn’t have
            too much room to jostle around. I started with about a base 6 by 7 inch box, but found it to be too unwieldy
            for pastries, so I cut it down to a base of 4 by 6 inches, and made it 3 inches tall. Then I went back to my
            template to scallop the edges of the folding sides so it would cater better to my brand in particular. To
            implement my brand patterns, I placed one image pattern completely over each box and placed my logo to be
            optically centered on each long side panel of the boxes. I used two brand patterns for two of the pastry
            boxes I ended up printing and folding together, one pattern in black and one in my deep raspberry brand
            color.
            For an additional brand application, I opted to do some coasters, because how can you run a pub without
            coasters? I started by measuring my own glasses and looking up the proper dimensions of coasters to come up
            with a 4 by 4 inch dimension. I then used a base of a square to cut away and create two large scalloped
            rounded edges to match with my symbol logo and pastry box. I had a much easier time creating the coasters,
            my main problem was the fact that I had kept developing and switching out my brand patterns, the main part
            of my coasters, so once I finalized my bitmap photograph patterns, it all came together. Using the same
            basic formula as my pastry box, I used my brand patterns in the same two colors and used both my word mark
            or symbol logo in the center of each coaster.
            I also designed some business cards for Madeleine’s. Using the same general formula for my coasters, I
            designed the back of the card with my brand patterns and each logo. For the informational side of my cards,
            I referenced the menu typographic hierarchy to organize my information.
            <h3> Brand Poster</h3>
            Finally! With all of my branding logos, colors, patterns, and applications complete, it was time to create a
            large overview poster of all the Madeleine’s brand guidelines. Since you’ve already read so much about the
            development of this brand, I’ll keep this section paragraph short. I used the hierarchy of what parts of the
            brand are most important, like the logos, brand equation, and menus and made those the largest on my poster,
            while some smaller pieces of information like the typeface and clear space had a bit less room.
            Feel free to read all of the brand guideline information given on the final version of my brand poster
            below. Thank you so much for reading! I hope you would want to enjoy a drink at Madeleine’s someday as well!
